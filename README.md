# Romi Autonomous Robot Project

## Overview
This project documents the design and implementation of an autonomous Romi robot developed to complete a multi-stage obstacle course. The robot integrates multiple sensors and control strategies to navigate, detect obstacles, and execute sequential behaviors without human intervention.

The system combines embedded programming, sensor integration, and control theory to create a reliable and repeatable autonomous platform.

## Key Features
- Line following using a reflectance sensor array  
- Closed-loop motor control with encoder feedback  
- Obstacle detection using bump sensors  
- Heading and motion tracking with an IMU (BNO055)  
- Discrete-time state observer for improved estimation  
- Modular task-based software architecture  
- Real-time user interface for tuning and debugging  

---

## System Architecture
The robot software is structured using a cooperative multitasking scheduler. Each major function is implemented as its own task, allowing for modular design and easier debugging.

Core subsystems include:
- Motor control (PI velocity loops)
- Line following (centroid-based control)
- IMU processing
- State observer
- Bump detection and safety response
- User interface and command handling
